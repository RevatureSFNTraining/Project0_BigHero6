Title of Project0: The Botolan Sambal Dictionary Project

Project Description: This website updates and further develops an existing dictionary database of Sambal words with glosses in English and Tagalaog. Botolan Sambal is a minority language in the Philippines where Tagalog and English are official languages. Tagalog is the national language.

The purpose of the dictionary project is twofold:

to update an existing dictionary and correct errors
to use the changing dictionary for computer-assisted translation also on the web for a future project.
A word entry at the most basic level consists of the following:

word
IPA phonetic transcription
recording of the pronunciation
gloss in English
gloss in Tagalog
part of speech
root word
definition in English
definition in Tagalog
example sentence
translated sentence in English
translated sentence in Tagalog
photo or illustration (optional)
source (name of contributor)
Users with login accounts can edit entries. Volunteer users need approval of the administrator but will be allowed to edit through restricted guest accounts.

The tools on the website are:

Sambal word search that displays the current entries by page
Reverse word search from English that returns all Sambal dictionary entries with the English gloss
Reverse word search from Tagalog that returns all Sambal dictionary entries with the English gloss
Form to edit entries
