Project 0 - I
(This will be the first part of an ongoing, more extensive project. Keep this in mind as the foundation you build here will need to support future endeavors.)

You will determine a business you want to model. This can be an actual company or one you create. This business will serve as the foundation for the remainder of Project 0 (Parts II, and III), as well as Project 1.

Wireframe
You will create a wireframe outline of your project website. This can be made using a variety of online wireframing software, such as figma, graphics editors such as google draw, or hand made on paper. Regardless of the method utilized a picture of it should be uploaded to your repo.

Lightning Web Components Open Source
You will use the LWC OSS framework to create a webpage for the company you've chosen. This webpage should consist of multiple Lightning web components that respond to user input. Additionally, one or more components must make use of conditional rendering.

Your webpage must be well-styled with a uniform design.

Git & Github
Your code should be routinely pushed to a Github repository that your trainer has access to.

Project 0 - II
This phase of the project will continue with the business or company that you chose for Project 0 - I, but will focus on beginning to implement a Salesforce org for that enterprise. 

Data Model 
You will need to create a thorough data model, beginning with an ERD and following through with its implementation inside the org. The data model should display your understanding of data modeling and how to implement a data model inside Salesforce. The knowledge demonstrated needs to include ERD's, object creation and customization, field creation and customization, and relationships.

The security should display your complete understanding of salesforce security and access, including Org Level, Object Level, Record Level, and Field Level.
