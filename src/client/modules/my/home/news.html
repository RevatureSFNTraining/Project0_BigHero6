            <h2>Background of Community College</h2>
                 
                <p>
                   A community college (also known as a junior college) is a higher education institution that provides a two year curriculum. 
                   Students can either pursue an Associate's Degree with a transfer to a 4 year university or without an Associate's degree.
                   Community college coursework focuses on academic programs that nurture a student's personal growth or development.
                <p>
                   
                <p>
                   Historically, community colleges were established in the early 20th century as a means to assist young adults that did not have money to attend a university. In the beginning, community colleges supported African Americans and women that wished to attend college. 
                   Students prepared for grammar school teaching positions or enrolled in new vocational education programs in community colleges. 
                   Community colleges offered students the option to pursue their education without having to travel outside of their home-towns.  
                </p>
                   
                <p> 
                   In the traditional sense, a community college student would to school to pick up a two year degree. 
                   In today's society, a community college student aims to continue on their education within a four year college.
